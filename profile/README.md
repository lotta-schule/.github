Lotta is a simple-to use platform aimed at schools.
Its comprehensible interface makes it easy for students and teachers

## Open Source

Schools are places that must allow for the greatest possible freedom,
while sheltering the pupils from big corporation interests.

We are a very small team (of three people), of whom two are teachers,
who have been frustrated by the situation at schools far too often.
The past has rarely offered a solution that ranged between: "We do
not want technology at our school's" and "Just force all the students
to Google, what could possibly go wrong?'

We have set ourselves to fix these problems, and the solution we propose
is lotta.
Lotta's source code is visible to you and the world, we want our
customers to see what happens with their data. We want the students
to see how the tool they're using daily works internally. After all,
school still is primary a place to learn.
